19 Feb 2018 -- dodgy looking trace with double sized buffer(SOLVED!)


Problem encountered when implement the double sized buffer: 
only initialised half of the buffer when the entire buffer is used.
x buffer is not in used else than increment the ptr(and read in the samples)

extend[2N]

extend[N+ptr]= x[ptr]; //original initialisation (only the latter half the buffer -- size N) the front half of the buffer is floating and
does not have valid data.

Now make use of the first half of the buffer with:
extend[ptr]= x[ptr];  //initialise the front half of the buffer
